## Create your own technical documentation. Breakdown and define each of the OOP principles in your own words.
Abstraction
Abstraction is "To represent the essential feature without representing the background details."
(Animal Class)

Encapsulation
Encapsulation is like enclosing in a capsule. That is, enclosing the related operations and data related to an object into that object.
(Gender in Mammales and Reproduces witheggs)

Inheritance
When a class includes a property of another class, it is known as inheritance. Inheritance is a process of object reusability.
(Mammales and Reproduces witheggs and animal classes)

Polymorphism
Polymorphism means one name, many forms. One function behaves in different forms. In other words, "Many forms of a single object is called Polymorphism."
(Sleep() Eat())
Provide under each OOP definition a couple (you do not have to define all) of examples of how you are applying this into your project.
